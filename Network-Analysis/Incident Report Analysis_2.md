# Incident Report Analysis

## Summary
The company experienced a security event where all network services abruptly stopped responding due to a **distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack**. The attack involved a flood of **ICMP packets** overwhelming the network. The cybersecurity team mitigated the attack by blocking malicious traffic, halting non-critical services, and restoring critical operations.

---

## Identify
- **Root Cause**: A DDoS attack via ICMP packet flooding targeted the companyâ€™s network infrastructure.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Complete disruption of internal network services.  
  - Critical systems required immediate restoration to resume operations.  
- **Gaps Identified**:  
  - Insufficient rate limiting for ICMP traffic.  
  - Lack of real-time monitoring for abnormal traffic patterns.  

---

## Protect
**Immediate Actions**:  
- Deployed a **firewall rule** to limit incoming ICMP packet rates.  
- Integrated an **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)** to filter suspicious ICMP traffic.  

**Long-Term Measures**:  
- Strengthened firewall configurations to preemptively block ICMP flood attacks.  

---

## Detect
**Enhanced Monitoring Tools**:  
- **Source IP Address Verification**: Implemented on the firewall to detect and block spoofed IP addresses in ICMP traffic.  
- **Network Monitoring Software**: Deployed to identify abnormal traffic patterns indicative of DDoS activity.  

---

## Respond
**Immediate Steps**:  
- Isolated affected systems to prevent further network disruption.  
- Prioritized restoration of **critical services** (e.g., customer-facing applications, internal communications).  

**Post-Incident Actions**:  
- Conducted log analysis to trace attack origins and identify compromised systems.  
- Reported the incident to **upper management** and relevant legal authorities as required.  

---

## Recover
**Restoration Process**:  
1. Blocked all external ICMP flood traffic at the firewall.  
2. Temporarily halted **non-critical services** to reduce network load.  
3. Restored critical systems first, followed by non-critical services once the attack subsided.  

**Future Preparedness**:  
- Scheduled **regular network traffic audits** to refine firewall rules.  
- Established a protocol to prioritize critical services during outages.

## Reflections/Notes
- Explore **cloud-based DDoS mitigation services** for scalable protection.  
- Conduct **simulated DDoS drills** to test response efficacy.  
- Review backup power and redundancy plans for critical infrastructure.
